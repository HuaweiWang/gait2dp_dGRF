To do the gait2dpi test, following is an example:

from test import gait2dp_dyn_test
gait = gait2dp_dyn_test()
gait.do_test('freefall')

Please replace 'freefall' to other names to apply different test:

'stick' : Stick figure test
'speed' : Speed test of the excutation
'sparsity' : Sparsity test of the derivatives
'grf' : Ground Reaction Force test
'freefall' : Freefall dynamics test
'derivatives' : Check derivatives of jacobian
